# Overview

- ### Purpose
    This project was created because I love to read Chinese novels. The website is entirely in Chinese, so I usually have to click on a random page, translate it into English, and see if the synopsis fits my taste before adding it to my Google Sheets. This project helps eliminate those issues by going through categories I am interested in, getting the title, translating it, and making sure it doesn't contain "forbidden" words that I am not interested in. It will then fetch the synopsis and translate it along with the title before adding it to a new Excel file.
  
- ### Efficiency / Effectiveness
  - It takes me approximately 4-5 minutes per page to read all the available titles on that page, pick out the title I'm interested in, and read the synopsis before putting it into sheets.
  - The program takes approximately 20-40 seconds per page to scan the titles, eliminate all the ones that contain words I'm not interested in, parse the synopsis, and add the novel to sheets.
